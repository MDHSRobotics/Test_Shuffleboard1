// Trivial - A trivial event such as a change in command state
// Low - A low importance event such as acquisition of a game piece.
// Normal - A "normal" importance event, such as a transition from autonomous mode to teleoperated control.
// High - A high-importance event such as scoring a game piece.
// Critical - A critically important event such as a brownout, component failure, or software deadlock.

// Note: Event names should be terse
